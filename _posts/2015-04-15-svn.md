####No 1 : svn: E155007: './blabla' is not a working copy
  > $ cd aaaa 
  > $ svn add ./
  > $ svn: E155007: '/cygdrive/d/aaaa' is not a working copy

This error is because the svn doesn't match the current path to the remote path.
It's a newbie error. ***SOLUTION :  *** After "svn checkout [https://the-remote-url]", just "cd" to the same path name as the folder downloded.
OK, a example makes things more clear.

  > $ cd /cygdrive/d/the-current-path/cinem
  > $ svn checkout https://the-remote-url/example
  > A    cinem/1
  > A    cinem/1/config.yaml
  > A    cinem/1/index.php
  > Checked out revision 1.
  > 
  > $ cd ./cinem/1
  
Well, that's fine.
